# CU-2824-Project
Project for 2824 at CU Boulder using RSA encryption

This project was the finished product for my 2824 class project. This is an RSA code project. 

This code will select prime numbers for you, generate keys, and encrypt/decrypt messages. 

There is also a code breaking function that will allow you to attempt to decrypt an RSA encrypted message using only the public key.

This code requires installation of the Pyfiglet module, which needs to be installed in your IDE prior to running.
Use 'pip install pyfiglet' in the Terminal to install the module.

This project was made in JupyterLab. To run it in JupyterLab, run all cells after installing 'pyfiglet' module.
